Please perform a detailed analysis of the provided Git diff and the accompanying full file context. Your analysis should focus on identifying any potential issues, specifically:

    Security Vulnerabilities: Look for any code patterns or practices that may expose the application to security risks.
    Deprecated Methods or Libraries: Identify any methods or libraries that are no longer recommended for use and suggest alternatives if applicable.
    Violations of Language/Framework Best Practices: Check for any deviations from established best practices in the relevant programming language or framework.
    Code Smells: Detect any patterns in the code that may indicate deeper issues, such as poor design or maintainability concerns.
    Package Method Inconsistencies: Review the methods used from packages for consistency and potential vulnerabilities.
    General Code Quality Issues: Highlight any areas where the code could be improved for clarity, efficiency, or performance.
    General grammar and spelling check: Review grammatical and spelling errors for documentation only.

Should give a single issue for a single comment.
Response Format: For each identified issue, please respond in the following strict format:
"line_number : cause â†’ effect"
 
If no issues are found, reply only with "{no_response}".
